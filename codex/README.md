# Fivetran Connector Builder — Codex CLI Plugin

Build, test, fix, and deploy Fivetran connectors with AI assistance, directly in Codex CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10-3.14
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed
- [Fivetran Connector SDK](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-connector-sdk/) — `pip install fivetran-connector-sdk`
- A Fivetran account (https://fivetran.com)

## Installation

See the [top-level README](../README.md#install) for the full install matrix. Quick path:

1. Enable the plugins feature in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [features]
   plugins = true
   ```

2. Add the marketplace and install:
   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add fivetran/connector_sdk_tools
   codex plugin add fivetran-connector-sdk@fivetran-connector-sdk-ai
   ```

   To update:
   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace upgrade fivetran-connector-sdk-ai
   ```

3. Enable the plugin in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [plugins."fivetran-connector-sdk@fivetran-connector-sdk-ai"]
   enabled = true
   ```

4. Install tool dependencies:

   macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r /path/to/codex/tools/requirements.txt
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install -r "C:\path\to\codex\tools\requirements.txt"
   ```

This dependency install is temporary. Until secure configuration entry is available directly in the Fivetran Connector SDK CLI, the plugin uses `tools/enter_configuration.py` to encrypt configuration values in `configuration.json`.

On first run, `enter_configuration.py` creates a local encryption secret under your user profile (`~/.fivetran/csdk_master_secret` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.fivetran\csdk_master_secret` on Windows). It uses that secret to write inline `ENCRYPTED:v1:<key_id>:local-fernet:` values for every field. The AI does not see plaintext configuration values.

Only `enter_configuration.py` creates the secret. The test and deploy tools require the existing secret to decrypt configuration values at runtime. To start configuration entry over, run `enter_configuration.py` again.

## Usage

Skills appear in the `$` mention popup:

- `$build_connector` — Research an API and generate a complete connector
- `$test_connector` — Run and validate your connector locally
- `$deploy_connector` — Package and deploy to Fivetran
- `$evaluate_connector` — Code review and quality report
- `$migrate_functions_connector` — Migrate a Fivetran Functions connector to Connector SDK
- `$migrate_meltano_connector` — Migrate a Meltano extractor or Singer tap to Connector SDK
- `$migrate_airbyte_connector` — Migrate an Airbyte source connector to Connector SDK

To fix or modify an existing connector, describe the problem or change in natural language — the plugin guides the agent through the fixer workflow (classification → pattern research → targeted fix).

## What's Included

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `skills/build-connector/` | Full generation workflow (research → generate → test → auto-fix) |
| `skills/test-connector/` | Run and validate connector tests |
| `skills/deploy-connector/` | Package and deploy to Fivetran |
| `skills/evaluate-connector/` | Static code review and scored report |
| `skills/migrate-functions-connector/` | Migrate Fivetran Functions connectors to Connector SDK |
| `skills/migrate-meltano-connector/` | Migrate Meltano extractors or Singer taps to Connector SDK |
| `skills/migrate-airbyte-connector/` | Migrate Airbyte source connectors to Connector SDK |
| `workflows/fixer.md` | Canonical fix workflow (applied when user reports an error or asks for a change) |
| `tools/enter_configuration.py` | Enter and encrypt API credentials |
| `tools/run_connector.py` | Run connector with runtime config via named pipe |
| `tools/deploy_connector.py` | Deploy connector with auto-discovered destination |

## Telemetry

This plugin collects anonymous usage data (skill name, plugin name and version, model, status (`started`, `ok`, or `fail`), session ID, timestamp) to help improve the product. No prompts, code, or personal information are collected. To opt out, add to your shell profile:

```bash
export FIVETRAN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Known Parity Gaps vs. Claude Code Plugin

- **Subagents**: Codex has no subagent concept. The validator/generator/fixer workflows are inlined in the relevant SKILL.md files instead of running as isolated subagents.
