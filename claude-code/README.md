# Fivetran Connector Builder — Claude Code Plugin

Build, test, fix, and deploy Fivetran connectors with AI assistance, directly in Claude Code.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.14
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- [Fivetran Connector SDK](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-connector-sdk/) — `pip install fivetran-connector-sdk`
- A Fivetran account (https://fivetran.com)

## Installation

See the [top-level README](../README.md#install) for the full install matrix. Quick path:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add fivetran/connector_sdk_tools
claude plugin install fivetran-connector-sdk@fivetran-connector-sdk-ai
```

Or from inside a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add fivetran/connector_sdk_tools
/plugin install fivetran-connector-sdk@fivetran-connector-sdk-ai
```

To update:

```bash
claude plugin update fivetran-connector-sdk@fivetran-connector-sdk-ai
```

### Post-installation

Install the tool dependencies:

macOS/Linux:
```bash
pip install -r /path/to/claude-code/tools/requirements.txt
```

Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
python -m pip install -r "C:\path\to\claude-code\tools\requirements.txt"
```

## Quick Start Tutorial

### Step 1: Start Claude Code with the Plugin

```bash
cd ~/my-connectors  # or wherever you want to create connectors
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-code
```

### Step 2: Build Your First Connector

In the Claude Code chat, describe the connector you want to build:

```
/build-connector <describe your data source and what tables you want to sync>
```

Claude will:
1. Research the API documentation
2. Ask you clarifying questions about scope and data requirements
3. Generate the connector code
4. Set up a Python virtual environment
5. Ask you to enter your API credentials

### Step 3: Enter Your API Credentials
When prompted, open a **separate terminal** and run:

macOS/Linux:
```bash
cd ~/my-connectors/your_connector
python -m pip install -r /path/to/claude-code/tools/requirements.txt
python /path/to/claude-code/tools/enter_configuration.py configuration.json
```

Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\my-connectors\your_connector"
python -m pip install -r "C:\path\to\claude-code\tools\requirements.txt"
python "C:\path\to\claude-code\tools\enter_configuration.py" "configuration.json"
```

Enter configuration values when prompted. Every field value is encrypted immediately as an inline `ENCRYPTED:v1:<key_id>:local-fernet:` value in `configuration.json`. Claude never sees plaintext configuration values.

The dependency install is temporary. Once secure configuration entry is available in the Fivetran Connector SDK CLI, this helper script flow will be replaced.

**First time only:** The tool creates a local encryption secret under your user profile (`~/.fivetran/csdk_master_secret` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.fivetran\csdk_master_secret` on Windows) and uses it immediately. Claude never sees the secret or plaintext configuration values.

Only `enter_configuration.py` creates the secret. The test and deploy tools require the existing secret to decrypt configuration values at runtime. To start configuration entry over, run `enter_configuration.py` again.

Go back to Claude Code and tell it you've entered your credentials.

### Step 4: Test the Connector

Claude will automatically run the first test. If it succeeds, you'll see:
- Tables synced
- Row counts for each table
- Sample data

If it fails, Claude will diagnose the issue:
- **INFRA error**: Network/infrastructure problem
- **FIRST_RUN error**: Likely a credentials or config issue — verify your API credentials
- **CODE error**: Claude will automatically fix the code and re-test

### Step 5: Iterate and Deploy

Once testing passes, you can:
- Ask Claude to add more tables or features
- Run `/test-connector` anytime to re-test
- Run `/migrate-functions-connector` to port an existing Fivetran Functions connector to Connector SDK
- Run `/migrate-meltano-connector` to port an existing Meltano extractor or Singer tap to Connector SDK
- Run `/migrate-airbyte-connector` to port an existing Airbyte source connector to Connector SDK
- Run `/deploy-connector` when ready to deploy to Fivetran

### Example Session

```
You: /build-connector <Your API> connector for <tables you want>

Claude: I'll build a connector for <Your API>. Let me research the API...
        [researches API docs]

        I have a few questions:
        1. <clarifying question about scope>
        2. <clarifying question about filtering>

You: <your answers>

Claude: Got it. Let me generate the connector...
        [creates <your_connector>/ directory with connector.py, configuration.json, README.md]
        [sets up virtual environment]

        Please enter your API credentials. In a separate terminal, run:
          python .../enter_configuration.py configuration.json

You: Done, I've entered my credentials

Claude: Running the connector test...
        [runs fivetran debug]

        ✅ Test passed!
        Tables synced:
          - <table_1>: X rows
          - <table_2>: Y rows

        Your connector is ready. Would you like to deploy it to Fivetran?
```

## Usage

### Build a New Connector
```
/build-connector Stripe API connector for payments, customers, and invoices
```

This will:
1. Research the API documentation
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Generate connector code following SDK best practices
4. Set up a virtual environment
5. Run an initial test
6. Auto-fix any code errors
7. Prompt you to enter configuration values (API credentials)

### Entering Configuration Values

After the connector is generated, you'll need to enter your API credentials. Run this in a **separate terminal**:

```bash
python -m pip install -r /path/to/claude-code/tools/requirements.txt
python /path/to/claude-code/tools/enter_configuration.py configuration.json
```

On first run, it creates a local encryption secret under your user profile. This encrypts local configuration values so the AI cannot see them.

### Test a Connector
```
/test-connector
```

Runs `fivetran debug`, checks `warehouse.db` for synced data, and reports results.

### Fix or Modify a Connector

Just describe the problem or change in natural language — no slash command needed:

```
I'm getting an authentication error: Invalid API key
```

or

```
Add a "pull requests" table to my GitHub connector
```

The plugin routes to the `connector-fixer` subagent, which classifies the error (INFRA / FIRST_RUN / CODE), researches the correct SDK pattern, and applies targeted fixes to `connector.py`.

### Deploy a Connector
```
/deploy-connector
```

Validates, runs a final test, and guides you through Fivetran deployment.

## How It Works

This plugin turns Claude Code into a Fivetran connector development tool by injecting:

1. **Domain knowledge** — Fivetran SDK patterns, best practices, and common pitfalls
2. **Workflow skills** — Step-by-step processes for building, testing, fixing, and deploying
3. **Specialized agents** — Subagents focused on research, generation, and debugging
4. **SDK examples** — Automatic fetching of relevant patterns from the official examples repo

Claude Code provides the AI conversation, file editing, terminal access, and git integration. This plugin adds the Fivetran-specific expertise on top.

## Telemetry

This plugin collects anonymous usage data (skill name, plugin name and version, model, status (`started`, `ok`, or `fail`), session ID, timestamp) to help improve the product. No prompts, code, or personal information are collected. To opt out, add to your shell profile:

```bash
export FIVETRAN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```
